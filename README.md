# Deploy machine learning models to production

Cortex is an open source platform for deploying, managing, and scaling machine learning in production.

<br>

## Model serving infrastructure

* Supports deploying TensorFlow, PyTorch, sklearn and other models as realtime or batch APIs.
* Ensures high availability with availability zones and automated instance restarts.
* Runs inference on spot instances with on-demand backups.
* Autoscales to handle production workloads.

<br>

## Reproducible deployments

* Package dependencies, code, and configuration for reproducible deployments.
* Configure compute, autoscaling, and networking for each API.
* Integrate with your data science platform or CI/CD system.
* Test locally before deploying to your cluster.

<br>

## Scalable machine learning APIs

* Scale to handle production workloads with request-based autoscaling.
* Stream performance metrics and logs to any monitoring tool.
* Serve many models efficiently with multi model caching.
* Configure traffic splitting for A/B testing.
* Update APIs without downtime.
