## Live-reloading model APIs

_WARNING: you are on the master branch; please refer to examples on the branch corresponding to your `cortex version` (e.g. for version 0.23.*, run `git checkout -b 0.23` or switch to the `0.23` branch on GitHub)_

Model live-reloading is automatically enabled for ONNX predictors.
